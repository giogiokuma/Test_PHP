Indoctrination is not to punish, but to do the complete opposite.
You don't have to get rid of crime to eat 
Don't be busy, just be productive
A closed heart cuts off loving people and often love in general from entering. 
You're never a loser until you quit trying 
When you win, say nothing, when you lose, say less.
